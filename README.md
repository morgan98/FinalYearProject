This was my final year project for Ulster University Jordanstown

It is a web application that uses the Spotify Web API to create playlists of recommendations based either on:

1. The user's listening history(Either top songs or top artists)
2. A selected song 
3. A selected artists
4. A selected Album
5 A selected Playlist

This application was created using React and Node JS and was written in JavaScript and JSX. Tailwind CSS was the CSS module used.
This project recieved a 1:1 Grade! 

Development of this project is more or less complete for the moment. I am currently working on a spirtual successor to this project called Mixtape(https://github.com/morgan98/mixtape). Mixtape will incorperate most of the features developed for this project, but is more focused on being a tool for creating Spotify playlists. I hope also hope to address some the shortcomings of this project, e.g. poor user experience on mobile devices with Mixtape.


This application runs on localhost:3000
Simply download the code and open the file location in your terminal of choice
Run either Yarn Start or NPM start 

Thank you
