Welcome to Songlab! 

This is an application that lets you create playlists using the Spotify API based on songs, artists, albums, 
or even you own listening History! The power of Spotify's recommendation engine is in your hands!

To begin just simply click on the login button below, using your Spotify™ account.

There is three main parts to the app. 
1. Seeds, the center piece of the application click the + button to start adding seeds which will be used
to create the playlist of Recommendations. Albums, artists, songs, playlists, and your top artists and tracks
can all be used to create a playlist.

2. Song Values, Songs values are features identifed by Spotify's recommendation engine, you can use these
values to adjust the output of the recommendation engine. E.g. if you want to a playlist made up more of
songs that are less popular, move the popularity slide to the left.

3. Playback, playback allows you to listen to the playlist you have generated. You can do that in two ways:
Device Playback - selected one of your devices(e.g. phone) to instantly start listening to the playlist
